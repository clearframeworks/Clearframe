          <h2 class="h2">What Clarity is</h2>

          <p class="p">
            Clarity is a practical framework for decision-making when budgets, bandwidth, and time are limited. It treats constraints as first-class inputs:
            money, time, staffing, eligibility requirements, transport, documentation, fatigue, volatility, and social cost.
          </p>

          <p class="p">
            Many “noncompliance” or “lack of follow-through” patterns become predictable once the option set is mapped honestly. Clarity makes the structure visible so interventions
            target the correct constraint instead of intensifying the wrong lever.
          </p>

          <h2 class="h2">How it works</h2>

          <p class="p">
            Clarity uses a stability-first method designed for low-bandwidth conditions. The first move is reducing distortion: urgency, fear, and compressed time horizons can make
            decisions feel binary when they aren’t. Then we map constraints and identify the smallest reversible steps that reduce downside risk.
          </p>

          <p class="p">
            The output is a usable decision map: a constraint profile, an option field, a near-term stabilization plan, and a conditional forward path that only activates once the foundation stops shaking.
            This prevents “plan collapse” caused by over-optimizing for ideal conditions.

            Clarity is a good fit when a person (or program) still has meaningful agency: there is room to take steps, adjust process, reduce friction, and stabilize conditions over time.
            It is also a good fit when staff are seeing repeated drop-off and want to identify structural failure modes rather than escalating enforcement.
          </p>

          <p class="p">
            Clarity is not a replacement for emergency support. If a person is in immediate survival crisis—no shelter, no food, active danger, acute medical or mental health crisis—the correct move is rapid access to local services first.

            In public systems, pressure is structural: limited budgets, limited staff, political risk, urgent timelines, and a constant stream of edge cases.

            Clarity makes “why isn’t this working?” answerable in operational terms: where the process exhausts people, where paperwork becomes a barrier, where time costs are invisible,
