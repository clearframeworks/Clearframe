# Ground Up Landscaping — Betav1 pitch page

This folder is a **drag-and-drop** single-page build meant for pitching a redesigned site.
It is *not* wired to send the contact form yet.

## What's included
- `index.html` (single-page conversion layout)
- `styles.css` (2026 conversion-first CSS, tighter vertical rhythm)
- `assets/img/` (high-res placeholder photos + optimized derivatives)
- `assets/brand/logo-placeholder.svg` (TEMP logo placeholder)
- `favicon.png`

## IMPORTANT: Logo note
Ground Up’s live site serves logos as `.webp` in a way I couldn't fetch in this environment.
So I included a **placeholder** logo.

**Fix (2 minutes):**
1) Download the official logo from the live site manually
2) Save it as:
   - `assets/brand/logo.webp` (or `logo.png`)
3) Replace references in `index.html` (search for `logo-placeholder.svg`)

## Replace placeholders (when you get their real photos)
1) Put real images in `assets/img/` (keep names or update paths in `index.html`)
2) Update service bullets to match Ground Up's real offers (I kept them broad but accurate)
3) OPTIONAL: add testimonials (best if real)
